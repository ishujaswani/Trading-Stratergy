- x do we need to inclue industry factors and style factors while calculating the returns??
  - yes we have to use 
- Yet have to hypertune parameters
- we have to do daily optimisation of portfolio
- in the end just take the alpha factors. 



incorporate style_factors and indutry_factors into the model. Use the function `get_formula` to do so. then build lasso and elasticnet 5 fold cv to select the best variables.

then hypertune multiple params of the linear model.


code a non-linear model to get alpha's. hypertune the non-linear model. perfome 5 fold cv on it.

test all models on the test data. 

model 1 
- linear model ols w lasso get_formula(candidate_alpha) (cv = 5)
- hypertune
- test on test data get accuracy

model 2
- linear model ols w elastic get_formula(candidate_alpha) (cv = 5)
- hypertune
- test on test data get accuracy

model 3 ()
- non-linear model get_formula(candidate_alpha) (cv = 5)
- hypertune
- test on test data get accuracy

What does the best model inclue:
1. top parameters
2. best RMSE from test
3. best alpha ()
