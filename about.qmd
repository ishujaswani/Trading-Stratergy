## Project Overview

This project focuses on advanced trading analysis, emphasizing meticulous data cleaning, robust optimization methods, and strategic portfolio management. Our aim is to use statistical and machine learning techniques to refine trading strategies, enhance risk management, and guide investment decisions effectively.

## Key Components

### Data Cleaning

In financial analysis, the integrity and quality of data are crucial. Our approach to data cleaning involves several critical steps:

- **Handling Missing Values**: We address missing data with techniques like imputation and interpolation to ensure our datasets are complete, enhancing the reliability of our analyses.
- **Outlier Treatment**: Outliers can significantly distort statistical analyses. We employ winsorization to limit their impact, setting extreme values to a specified percentile, thus maintaining a distribution closer to the majority of the data.
- **Data Standardization**: Ensuring consistency in our data metrics is essential for reliable analysis. We standardize data across various scales to enable accurate comparisons and aggregations.

### Optimisation Techniques

The project employs several optimization methods for both model selection and portfolio construction:

- **Model Selection**: Using Lasso and Elastic Net regression, we identify significant alpha factors from a range of potential predictors, ensuring that our models focus on the most impactful variables. We also explore non-linear models, such as XGBoost, to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data.
- **Efficient Portfolio Optimization**: We use the Woodbury Matrix Inversion Lemma within the framework of Markowitz's mean-variance optimization to construct portfolios. This approach balances the trade-off between maximizing returns and minimizing risk.

### Portfolio Management

Our dynamic portfolio management system includes:

- **Analyzing Residual Returns**: We focus on the residuals of asset returns to identify unique alpha opportunities, seeking profits beyond what the market typically offers.
- **Implementing Backtesting**: Through rigorous backtesting, we assess the performance of our models and strategies over historical data, providing insights into their effectiveness and robustness over time.
- **Risk Management**: We actively calculate and monitor risk metrics, including total and idiosyncratic risk, to manage our portfolios effectively, ensuring that our strategies are aligned with our risk tolerance levels.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Our primary tool for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and machine learning.
- **Quarto**: Used for documenting our analysis in a clear, reproducible format.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Essential for efficient data processing and numerical operations.
- **Statsmodels & Scikit-Learn**: For conducting regression analyses and model validation.
- **XGBoost**: An advanced machine learning tool for capturing more complex data patterns.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing data and insights.

## Project Outcomes

This project aims to deliver:

1. **Robust Trading Strategies**: By leveraging data-driven insights and advanced analytical methods, we aim to develop more effective and resilient trading strategies.
2. **Improved Risk Management**: Through our sophisticated risk assessment and portfolio optimization methods, we aim to enhance the management of investment risks.
3. **Transparent Analysis**: We provide comprehensive documentation of our methodologies and findings, ensuring that our analysis is transparent and reproducible.

## Future Directions

Our future plans include:

- **Incorporating Real-Time Data**: To adapt our strategies to the current market conditions and dynamics.
- **Exploring Alternative Models**: Investigating deep learning and other advanced techniques for more nuanced and accurate market predictions.
- **Expanding Asset Coverage**: Diversifying our strategies across various asset classes and geographies to manage risk and explore new opportunities.
